## Usage

⚠️ **IMPORTANT!** ⚠️

️Before you get started, you need to register as a developer on the [Unsplash Developer portal](https://unsplash.com/developers).
Once registered, create a new app to get an **Access Key**.
 
Remember you must keep key secret.

### Initial Configuration

You need to add **Access Key** to your `local.properties`:

```
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="<Access Key>"
```
